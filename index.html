    <p>you've enhanced my life in so many ways and i wouldn't trade the experiences we've had together for anything except maybe 
      for some choongman. not only are you the funniest person to step on this planet, you're patient, kind, and caring and i couldn't 
      ask for a better partner. i'll  owe you for a lifetime for showing me what genuine love feels like, where i'm allowed to continue 
      to be my own and where we learn to adjust our love as we go through our own unievitable changes. when i think i've hit the max limit 
      of my love for you, i'm proven wrong every single time. the way you move in life, your treatment towards family and friends, your interests
      and goals all further intensify my admiration and respect for you. i hope the cosomos grant us an infinite amount of time together, no matter
      the obstacles!
      i love you.
